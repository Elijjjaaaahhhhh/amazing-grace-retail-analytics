### Database Scripts (database/)

**Note:** The SQL scripts themselves were NOT generated in this session because:
1. You've already finalized all working versions in your previous work
2. You have the final scripts that successfully generated all ~100K records
3. Those scripts need to be copied from your SSMS environment

**What I've created is the repository STRUCTURE** where those scripts will go:

```
database/
├── schema/
│   ├── 01_create_database.sql      ← Put your database creation script here
│   ├── 02_create_dimensions.sql    ← Put your 5 dimension table DDL here
│   └── 03_create_facts.sql         ← Put your 7 fact table DDL here
│
├── data/
│   ├── 01_populate_dimcategories.sql       ← Your categories script
│   ├── 02_populate_dimsubcategories.sql    ← Your subcategories script
│   ├── 03_populate_dimbellsizes.sql        ← Your bell sizes script
│   ├── 04_populate_dimitemgrades.sql       ← Your grades script
│   ├── 05_generate_dimdate.sql             ← Your date dimension script
│   ├── 06_generate_factloans.sql           ← Your final loans script
│   ├── 07_generate_factloanrepayments.sql  ← Your final repayments script

│   ├── 09_generate_factitems.sql           ← Your final items script
│   ├── 10_generate_factsales.sql           ← Your final sales script
│   ├── 11_generate_factexpenses.sql        ← Your expenses script

## 🎯 Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Copy Your SQL Scripts
From your SSMS, copy the **final working version** of each script into the appropriate folder:

**From your conversation history, the final versions are:**
- DimDate: The corrected version with Jan 4 opening + holidays
- FactLoans: The version with 8 loans and proper interest calculation
- FactLoanRepayments: The version with 90% on-time payments
- FactBells: The version with weighted distributions AND proper constraint handling
- FactItems: The version with the improved sell-through logic
- FactSales: The version with MERGE-based ID mapping
- FactExpenses: The corrected version without DayOfMonth column issues
- FactCashMovements: The version I need to create (you said you completed it but we didn't paste the final version in this session)

**TIP:** For each file, grab the LAST version that worked successfully before you moved to the next table.

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# On your local machine:
cd path/to/amazing-grace-retail-analytics

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete data warehouse with ~100K records"

# Create repo on GitHub (at github.com/Elijjjaaaahhhhh)
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Elijjjaaaahhhhh/amazing-grace-retail-analytics.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Add Screenshots (Optional but Recommended)
Create `assets/screenshots/` folder and add:
- Verification query results
- Sample data from each table
- Row count summaries
- Constraint validation (showing 0 violations)
